//We'll need the following tasks:
//	*	build: Builds the engine modules with Cargo.
//		Should be able to specify debug/release.
//	*	test: Tests the engine modules with Cargo.
//		Again, debug/release distinction matters.
//	*	package: Packs modules into an archive/installer.
//		This is different from build because the result *will*
//		be one artifact that can ideally be installed without
//		interaction.
