//For now this is empty. As we make tools,
//each should have its own build.gradle with
//build, test, and package steps.
//This project will eventually want a package step for those
//subprojects:
//	*	package: Packs tool artifacts into an archive/installer.
//		Result must be one artifact that can
//		ideally be installed without interaction.
