//For now this is empty. As we make tools,

//		Remember to distinguish debug/release!
task doBuild {//dependsOn:[":client:doBuild",":server:doBuild"]) {

task doTest {//dependsOn:[":client:doTest",":server:doTest"]) {

//	*	doPackage: Packs all artifacts into an archive/installer.
//		Result must be one artifact that can
//		ideally be installed without interaction.
