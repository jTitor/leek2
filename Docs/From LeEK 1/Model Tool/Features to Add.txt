* Model previewer?
	* How do you display the model?
	
	* How do you reload the model?
		* Model's already built inside ModelImporterLibrary,
		add functions to directly manipulate model data (material GUIDs and colors)
		* That means using the engine's GUID format - how do you resolve the GUIDs?
			* Can specify resource files to load.
			* This also lets you build GUIDs without typing, in theory
